# TapeNail: Secure Your Phone Access Through Your Nail

**TapeNail** is a hardware-software authentication system that uses passive 3D optical patterns embedded in nail art to unlock smartphones. The system leverages polarized light, real-time camera capture, and a lightweight deep learning model to detect and verify unique, user-defined optical signatures without relying on permanent biometrics.
